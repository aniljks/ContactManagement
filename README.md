To set up this project publish DB with SQL Server and then run the web solution 

I have choose asp.net core with EF and sql server for this application. This is a small application and asp.net core provide lot of boiler plate code for the project. 

I have user repository pattern, adaptor pattern along with seperate service which easily can reused for web api if required to scale the application. 

We can create seperate projects for model and entity but as of now we have only one class so I have not created sepearate projects.

I am not able to complete the unit test project due to time constraint. 

Many Thanks
